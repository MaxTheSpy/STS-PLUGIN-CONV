# About


### Key Features



## Installation

CONV is available through the SimpleToolSuite plugin manager and does not have to be downloaded seperatly. If for some reason it is not available through the built in Plugin Manager, follow these steps

1. Download CONV
2. Open SimpleToolSuite and navigate to the settings tab.
3. Under Plugin Location, select the "Open" button.
4. Drag and drop your STS-PLUGIN-CONV folder into your plugin folder.
5. Navigate back to the plugins tab and click "Load Plugin"
6. Select CONV and click launch.

If CONV does not show in your plugins list after you click Load Plugins, verify that your plugin folder structure is correct. Your folder structure should be: `SimpleToolSuite/Plugins/STS-PLUGIN-CONV/`

If you run into any problems throughout the process feel free to scroll back up to the top, and either join our discord to ask questions, or report a bug!
